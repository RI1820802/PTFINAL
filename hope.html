        Message of Hope
        <div class="content">
            <p>That feeling of being in the dark, its all too familiar isn't it?
            <br> It's as if you've been there. 
            <br>After all, grief and despair is a part of everyones humanity. 
            <br>Though this is true doesn't mean we have to stay in the dark though.
            <br>Despair may be a part of us but so is hope. 
            <br>Hope is not attained but something unlocked. 
            <br>It's something you must uncover deep in your heart. 
            <br>Which is why there's no such thing as a "hopeless'' situation. 
            <br>So as long as you have your heart intact of course.
            
            <p>The design we've created simply embodies 
            <br>that after a depressing night is a beautiful morning. 
            <br>Or in simpler terms, giving everyone hope that 
            <br>after all the trouble and pain we've been 
            <br>through is a better life for all of us. 
            <br>That the sunrise will always come.
